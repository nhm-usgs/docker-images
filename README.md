# USGS National Hydrologic Model (NHM), Docker Images
Code to build National Hydrologic Model, Docker images.

# Base Docker Image
The base Docker image is currently
[Anaconda](https://hub.docker.com/r/continuumio/anaconda3).

# Source Code Directory
Source code is installed under `/usr/local/src`. Currently, this is
[gridmetetl](https://github.com/nhm-usgs/gridmetetl),
[onhm-runners](https://github.com/nhm-usgs/onhm-runners),
[onhm-verify-eval](https://github.com/nhm-usgs/onhm-verify-eval), and
[PRMS](https://github.com/nhm-usgs/prms).

# Running

To run the app, run `compose-test.sh`.

## Running on Windows

We have not had success running the app on the Windows version of
Docker. Whether this is due to the global network security
configuration of Windows within .usgs.gov, or specific to Docker on
Windows itself (or both), we are unsure.

If running the app on Windows within .usgs.gov, we recommend running
Docker Compose on [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
(see below).

## Running on Oracle VM VirtualBox

1. install Oracle VM VirtualBox;
2. create a Linux virtual machine managed by Oracle VM VirtualBox
using the installation image of distro. of your choice (we use
[CentOS 7](https://www.centos.org/), but this is not required);
3. install Git, Docker Compose and wget on the Linux virtual machine;
4. clone the `docker-images` repo. on the virtual machine;
5. run the `compose-test.sh` script as described under **Running** above.

## Running on HPC Architecture

To build the Docker images in preparation for upload to
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), run the script `build.sh`.

To upload the Docker images to Docker Hub, run the script `push.sh`.

This might take a while, especially if you are running it via a home
broadband connection.

Login to your HPC machine, and either clone the `docker-images` repo.:

```
git clone -b shifter https://github.com/nhm-usgs/docker-images.git
```

or run `git pull` to update your existing repo.:

```
cd docker-images
git pull
```

Now run the `pull.sh` script, to download and convert the Docker
images to Shifter images.

Be aware that at this time, Shifter pull errors are quite common, so
don't be surprised by `FAIL` messages from the `pull.sh` script. If
this happens, run the script again, and Shifter should pick up where
it left off. A new revision of Shifter promises to solve this problem.

When the required Shifter images are present, run the pipeline with
the command `run-shifter`.

The script will submit each container run to Slurm, and `stdout` from
the Slurm jobs will be directed to files in the current directory with
a `.out` suffix. Logs and error messages from each container run
should be saved in these files.

The `nhm.env` file (in this directory) contains environment variable
defaults that may need to be changed for testing purposes. Comments in
this file explain the function of each environment variable.
